           <p>Farmers have great importance in our society. They are the ones who provide us food. Since every person needs proper food for their living, so they are a necessity for the society.
            There are different types of farmers, and they all have equal significance. First are the farmers who grow a crop like wheat, barley, rice, etc. Since the maximum intake in Indian households is of wheat and rice. Farmers who grow these crops are of prime importance. Second, are the ones who cultivate fruits.
            These farmers have to prepare soil specially for different types of fruits. Because these fruits grow according to the season. Therefore the farmers need to have a great knowledge of fruits and crops. There are many other farmers who grow crops of other types. Furthermore, they all have to work hard to get maximum harvesting.
            In addition to above, the farmers contribute almost 18 per cent the Indian economy. That is the maximum of all. But still, a farmer is deprived of every luxury of society.
